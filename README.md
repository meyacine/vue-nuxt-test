## Build Setup
You can clone the repository, install dependencies, and play with it. 
In this project we use yarn as dependencies manager. You'll notice that with the commited yarn.lock file.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 (Dev purpose only)
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
